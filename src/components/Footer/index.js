            <p data-test="content">
              I graduated from the University of Texas 
              in Austin with a B.A. in psychology and 
              afterwords, like many of us, had no idea 
              what to do for a career. I spent many years 
              exploring my interests in film making, 
              music, painting, history, literature, 
              engineering, medicine and about a dozen 
              other things while paying the bills with 
              office jobs, sales jobs, service industry 
              jobs, you name it. And then I discovered 
              software development and coding.
            </p>
            <p data-test="content">
              After learning the basics I completed the 
              front-end development course at freeCodeCamp 
              and then went on to learn full stack application 
              development at the University of YouTube and 
              Stack Overflow Academy, with lots of help from <a

              I currently live in the Houston area and in my 
              free time enjoy playing guitar and piano 
              and watching various sports of all kinds.
